# Prime Numbers Again

Create a console app to find the first 1000 prime numbers.  A prime number is a number that is only divisible by itself and the number one.  Simple right? However, what I'm really interested in is how quickly you can find the nth prime number.  

To pass this assignment you must prompt the user for the nth prime (where n < 2000000) and your code must produce the correct result in 10 seconds or less.
